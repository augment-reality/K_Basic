----------------------------    To do   -------------------------------------------

Not all card resolutions need an ending notification: Temple has been resolved is superfluous
Longer delay after each card resolution, and between each hktoken move
Merge notifications"Round has ended. Unhappy religions lose families and all religions pray." and "Card resolution complete. Proceeding to convert/pray phase"
-add padding to player cards?
✓ prayer pool updates immediately after global disaster choices and card purchases
✓ non-round leader players can only play one card per round (round leader can play multiple)
use <i class="fa-solid fa-xmark"></i> and <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> instead of pngs?
-test die roll sound
-add auto pass to non-round leader players who have no prayer during card playing?
-add text info to tooltip?
-Review and consolidate messages
-add a preference to force players to sacrifice their leader after x turns to avoid endless games?
-add sounds https://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/Game_interface_logic:_yourgamename.js#Sounds 
-undo buttons? Maybe just confirm buttons instead (convert/pray)?
-add game option to end game if all players family count is zero?
-For mobile: don't show tooltips, and move dice to right of main board?
-Group cards when a player has more than one of any specific card (maybe with BGA-Cards?)
